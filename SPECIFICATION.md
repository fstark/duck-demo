The python virtual environment is in venv

The implementation should be python (probably django, but this is not mandatory).

The database is sqllite.



Below is a demo flow that’s *small*, but feels real: one new order that needs negotiation, and one existing customer asking for status.

---

## Minimal demo dataset (so the flow can “compute”)

### Items

* **ELVIS-DUCK-20CM** (finished good)
* **MARILYN-DUCK-20CM** (finished good)
* **PVC-PELLETS**, **BLACK-DYE**, **YELLOW-DYE**, **BOX-SMALL** (materials)

### Stock (finished goods)

* **ELVIS-DUCK-20CM**: 12 units in FinishedGoods/Bin-12
* **MARILYN-DUCK-20CM**: 12 units in FinishedGoods/Bin-14
  (So: we can’t ship 24 Elvis, but we can ship 12 Elvis + 12 Marilyn now.)

### Production capacity (simplified)

* Production lead for finished goods is **~30 days**. An extra Elvis batch would finish around **Jan 19** and arrive around **Jan 21**, so it cannot help a Jan 10 request.
* Enough raw material exists; the constraint is time (long lead), not supply.

### PriceList rules (simple but convincing)

* Unit price: €12 each
* 24+ units: 5% discount
* Free shipping over €300

---

## Demo Flow A: New customer email → negotiation → order creation

### Step A1 — Input to **Sales Agent MCP**

User pastes the email:

> **From:** John Doe (DuckFan Paris)
> **Subject:** Need 24 Elvis ducks for Jan 10
> Hi,
> I’d like to order **24 Elvis Presley rubber ducks (20cm)** delivered to Paris **no later than Jan 10**.
> Can you confirm availability and send a quote?
> Thanks,
> John

**Sales Agent actions (MCP calls you’ll want):**

1. `crm_search_customers(name="John Doe", company="DuckFan Paris")` (then `crm_create_customer(...)` if not found)
2. `check_item_availability(item="ELVIS-DUCK-20CM", qty=24, date=Jan10)`
3. `suggest_alternatives()` based on stock + lead time
4. `draft_reply_email()` (important: give options)

### Step A1 — Expected outcome (what your MCP should return)

* Customer exists/created
* Availability result: **12 in stock now**; any additional Elvis would only arrive **around Jan 21** (30-day production lead + transit).
* Alternatives:

  * Option 1: **Stock mix** — ship **12 Elvis + 12 Marilyn** from stock to arrive by **Jan 10**.
  * Option 2: **Keep all Elvis** — ship **12 Elvis** by **Jan 10**, with the remaining **12 Elvis** arriving around **Jan 21** (production).
  * Option 3: **All Elvis later** — single shipment of **24 Elvis** arriving around **Jan 21** (production + transit).

### Step A1 — Draft reply (sales agent output)

You want the agent to produce a real “sendable” email draft like:

* Confirm what’s possible
* Offer choices
* Ask for confirmation on substitution/split

Example draft (tone: helpful + concrete):

> Hi John,
> Thanks for your request. For **ELVIS-DUCK-20CM**, we have **12 units in stock** and can deliver those to Paris by **Jan 10**.
> For the remaining 12, you have two options:
>
> 1. **Stock mix now:** ship **12 Elvis + 12 Marilyn (20cm)** together to arrive by **Jan 10**; or
> 2. **All Elvis later:** ship **12 Elvis** to arrive by **Jan 10**, then ship the remaining **12 Elvis** with expected arrival around **Jan 21** (production lead is ~30 days).
>    If you tell me which option you prefer (and your delivery address), I’ll send a formal quote right away.
>    Best regards,
>    (Your name)

That email is the “demo moment” because it shows reasoning grounded in stock and lead time.

---

### Step A2 — Customer responds (paste into Sales Agent)

> Hi,
> Let’s do **12 Elvis + 12 Marilyn**, all delivered by Jan 10. Address: …
> Please proceed.
> John

**Sales Agent MCP actions**

1. `sales_create_order(customer, lines=[...], requested_ship_date=Jan8/Jan9)`
2. `reserve_stock(item, qty, location)` (or create pick request)
3. `sales_price_order(sales_order_id, pricelist="Retail EU 2026")`
4. `logistics_create_shipment(sales_order_id, planned_departure=Jan8, planned_arrival=Jan10)`
5. `draft_order_confirmation_email()`

**Sales agent output should include**

* SalesOrder created (2 lines)
* Shipment created (planned dates)
* Pricing applied (including any discount + free shipping)
* A clean confirmation email

---

## Demo Flow B: Another customer asks “where is my order?”

You absolutely should include this — it proves your MCP can query state across contexts.

### Background data you pre-create

Customer **Sarah Martin** has two orders:

* **SO-1030**: 10× CLASSIC-DUCK-10CM → already shipped yesterday
* **SO-1037**: 50× ELVIS-DUCK-20CM → in production, not yet shipped

### Step B1 — Input email to **Support/Sales Agent MCP**

> **From:** Sarah Martin
> **Subject:** Order status?
> Hi, can you tell me the status of my last two orders?
> One was small ducks, the other Elvis ducks.
> Thanks,
> Sarah

**Agent actions**

1. `crm_search_customers(name="Sarah Martin")`
2. `sales_search_orders(customer_id, last_n=2)`
3. For each order:

   * if shipped: `logistics_get_shipment(shipment_id)`
   * if in production: `production_get_order(production_order_id)` (progress by operations)
4. `draft_reply_email()` summarizing in plain language

**Draft reply example**

> Hi Sarah,
> Here’s the latest on your two orders:
>
> * **SO-1030 (10× Classic Duck 10cm):** shipped on **Dec 19**, carrier tracking shows it is **in transit** with expected delivery **Dec 22**.
> * **SO-1037 (50× Elvis Duck 20cm):** currently **in production**; molding is complete and the batch is in the **painting step**. We expect it to ship on **Dec 23**.
>   If you’d like, I can split the shipment so you receive any completed quantity earlier.
>   Best regards,
>   (Your name)

That’s a great “multi-context retrieval” demo: orders + shipment + production.

## How to structure MCP “agent contexts” cleanly

Even if it’s one server, it helps to present it as distinct tool sets:

### Sales context tools

* customer lookup/create
* quote/pricing
* sales order create/update
* reservation request
* shipment creation

Additional CRM helpers

* `crm_search_customers` returns possible matches
* `crm_create_customer` explicitly creates a customer
* `crm_get_customer` returns profile plus recent/pending orders

### Inventory context tools

* stock by item/location
* reserve/unreserve
* stock moves (pick, consume, produce, receive)

### Production context tools

* create production order from demand
* check capacity / lead time estimate
* operation progress updates
* consume ingredients / report finished qty

### Logistics context tools

* shipment planning
* shipment status updates
* link shipment ↔ sales order

This separation makes the demo feel like “agents” even if it’s one backend.

---

## A very workable “first demo script” (short)

1. Paste John’s email → Sales agent proposes options (key moment)
2. Paste John’s confirmation → Sales agent creates SO + Shipment + confirmation email
3. Paste Sarah status email → Agent returns one shipped + one in production + a reply

That’s enough to prove:

* reasoning
* data creation
* cross-module querying
* consistent terminology/state

---

Below is a **concrete demo transcript** you can use as the “golden path” for your MCP server. It’s written as a sequence of:

* **User input** (email pasted into the agent)
* **Agent → MCP tool calls** (what the agent asks the server to do)
* **MCP responses** (structured, grounded state changes / lookups)
* **Agent output** (draft reply email + what it “pseudo-sends”)

Assumptions (for realism + determinism):

* Today is **Sat, Dec 20, 2025** (Europe/Paris).
* Delivery promise dates are in **January 2026**.
* The dataset already contains Items/Locations/Machines and some Stock.

## Scenario A — New order + negotiation

### A1) Customer email arrives (user pastes into Sales Agent)

**User → Sales Agent (pasted email)**

Hi,
I’d like to order **24 Elvis Presley rubber ducks (20cm)** delivered to Paris **no later than Jan 10, 2026**.
Can you confirm availability and send a quote?
Thanks,

# Notes (so this works smoothly in “real demo life”)

* The transcript intentionally shows **cross-context reasoning**:

  * Sales checks inventory
  * Sales proposes substitution
  * Sales reserves stock
  * Logistics plans shipment
  * Status inquiry pulls shipment + production progress
* You don’t need “perfect ERP”: you just need **consistent state transitions** and **credible outputs**.
* If you want to weave in **StockMove** explicitly during shipping/production, add two visible actions later:

  * “Pick for shipment” stock moves out of FG bin
  * “Consume materials / receive finished goods” stock moves during production reporting

Great — now we freeze the scope and make this **boringly solid** 🙂

Below is a **minimal, demo-safe SQLite schema** that supports **exactly** the MCP functions and demo transcript you approved.
No extra columns, no future-proofing, no accounting depth.

This schema is intentionally:

* **Readable**
* **Queryable by an agent**
* **Easy to seed with mock data**
* **Stable for the demo**

---

# Design principles for this schema

* One table = one concept from the demo
* Only attributes that are:

  * referenced by MCP calls
  * needed to compute demo logic
  * needed to draft emails / statuses
* No hard constraints that would block demo flows
* Foreign keys are logical, not strict (SQLite-friendly)

---

# Core reference tables

## customers

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    company TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    city TEXT
);
```

Used by:

* `crm_search_customers`, `crm_create_customer`, `crm_get_customer`
* sales orders
* email drafting

---

## items

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sku TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL            -- finished_good / material
);
```

Unified **Item** concept:

* finished ducks
* materials
* packaging (if needed later)

---

# Inventory

## stock

```sql
CREATE TABLE stock (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    warehouse TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    on_hand REAL NOT NULL,
    reserved REAL NOT NULL
);
```

Used by:

* `inventory_get_stock`
* availability checks
* reservation logic

> Available = `on_hand - reserved` (computed, not stored)

---

## stock_reservations

```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_reservations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    reference_type TEXT NOT NULL,   -- sales_order
    reference_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    qty REAL NOT NULL,
    warehouse TEXT,
    location TEXT
);
```

Used by:

* `inventory_reserve_stock`
* tying reservations to a sales order

---

# Sales

## sales_orders

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_orders (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    requested_delivery_date TEXT,
    ship_to_line1 TEXT,
    ship_to_postal_code TEXT,
    ship_to_city TEXT,
    ship_to_country TEXT,
    note TEXT,
    status TEXT                    -- draft / confirmed
);
```

Used by:

* order creation
* order lookup
* shipment linking

---

## sales_order_lines

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_order_lines (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sales_order_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    qty REAL NOT NULL
);
```

Used by:

* pricing
* shipment contents
* availability logic

---

## sales_order_pricing

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_order_pricing (
    sales_order_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    currency TEXT NOT NULL,
    subtotal REAL NOT NULL,
    discount REAL NOT NULL,
    shipping REAL NOT NULL,
    total REAL NOT NULL
);
```

Used by:

* `sales_price_order`
* email confirmations

---

## email_drafts

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_drafts (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    to_address TEXT NOT NULL,
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    sent_at TEXT
);
```

Used by:

* draft generation
* pseudo-send tracking

---

# Logistics

## shipments

```sql
CREATE TABLE shipments (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    ship_from_warehouse TEXT,
    ship_to_line1 TEXT,
    ship_to_postal_code TEXT,
    ship_to_city TEXT,
    ship_to_country TEXT,
    planned_departure TEXT,
    planned_arrival TEXT,
    status TEXT,                    -- planned / in_transit / delivered
    tracking_ref TEXT
);
```

---

## shipment_lines

```sql
CREATE TABLE shipment_lines (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    shipment_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    qty REAL NOT NULL
);
```

Used by:

* shipment creation
* shipment status replies

---

## sales_order_shipments

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_order_shipments (
    sales_order_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    shipment_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (sales_order_id, shipment_id)
);
```

Simple link table, used by:

* status lookups
* customer communication

---

# Production (read-only for demo)

## production_orders

```sql
CREATE TABLE production_orders (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    qty_planned REAL NOT NULL,
    qty_completed REAL NOT NULL,
    current_operation TEXT,
    eta_finish TEXT,
    eta_ship TEXT
);
```

Used only by:

* `production_get_order`
* order status demo for Sarah

No execution logic needed.

---

# Optional but helpful seed tables (very small)

## pricelists

```sql
CREATE TABLE pricelists (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    currency TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## pricelist_lines

```sql
CREATE TABLE pricelist_lines (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    pricelist_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    unit_price REAL NOT NULL
);
```

Discount logic can be hard-coded in MCP for demo purposes (24+ units → 5%).

---

# What is deliberately NOT in this schema

* Invoices tables (you didn’t execute them in demo)
* Machines, operators, recipes, ingredients
* Warehouses / locations as master data tables
* Stock moves
* Payments, accounting
* Users / auth
* Status history tables

All of those would add complexity without improving the demo.

---

# Mental check: does this schema support the full demo?

✔ Paste customer email → customer
✔ Check stock → stock + reservations
✔ Propose substitution → items + stock
✔ Create sales order → sales_orders + lines
✔ Reserve stock → stock_reservations
✔ Price order → sales_order_pricing
✔ Create shipment → shipments + shipment_lines
✔ Order status email → shipments + production_orders
